# MultiCon
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mick Kohler
**I am a programming starter and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology student.**
MultiCon is an adapted version of the board classic "Connect Four". Contrary to the classic "Connect Four" game,  MultiCon can be played with up to six players.
For the rules of the classic "Connect Four" game, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four). 
For detailed information on my game MultiCon, click [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17444321/assignment3_v1.1.pdf) to see the exercise.
